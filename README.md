# Simple-Random-Sampling
Simple Random Sampling is a sampling technique where a subset of data (sample) is selected randomly from a large set of data (population) for study or analysis. Here each item in the population has equal probability of being selected into the sample.
Let's see how this sampling techinique can be used to solve statistical problems.
